                <p id="content">Not too long ago I read "The Undiscovered Self", by Carl G. Jung, 
                     and also listened to Jordan Peterson's Biblical lecture series. 
                     Both are very interesting and insightful. Below is a piece of writing I wrote
                    in reflecting on what I learned through the lense of my Christian faith. 
                    It is largely unedited since I first typed out my thoughts, and so in some places it
                    contains a fair amount of jargon. My apologies:</p>
                
                <p id="content">
                    The world is made up of a multitude of individuals. So also is each state. Each community. Every movement. The individual is the undividable increment. The atom of the human world. Yet within each person is a divide like that of Right and Left. There’s the rational ego and the irrational shadow. The human being has become so divorced from their natural beginnings through their capacity to learn. The accrual of knowledge and the change toward civilisation, multiple millenia down the line the instincts are left neglected. Our two main instincts, the sexual instinct and the power instinct, rear their ugly head in behaviour we cannot explain with rationality. 
                </p>
                <p id="content">Modern people like to think with their enlightened consciousness that the moral high ground can be held by the self, and the atrocities are the other. The worst crimes committed by other human beings, the emphasis is given to the “other” and not to the “human being”. The realisation of the depths of human depravity leads naturally to the realisation that, in sharing in that same human nature, the self is also implicated in the darkness that characterises the worst atrocities.</p>
                <p id="content">God said to Cain: “... sin is a croucher at the door and its desire is to have you, but you must rule over it.” Rational human beings have forgotten their instincts. The shadow lurks in the unconscious, pulling strings in the human mind and emotions, not receiving the recognition for its effects. Cain was ruled by the croucher, in the same way that the croucher within each person knocks. If each person ignores the croucher then it will surely pounce on them, but any man who is willing to rekindle the bond between the conscious and the unconscious surely keeps a wary eye on the croucher. It is only in delving into the depths of what one is capable of doing is the human being able to recognise the nobility of what it is capable of. That the elements of the Christian faith can be interpreted symbolically and applied to the human psyche is of no doubt. </p>
                <p id="content">The historical reality of Christ’s resurrection only serves to deepen the meaning within the biblical narrative. That the symbolic interpretation serves to deepen the human understanding of its stained self, only serves to deepen the awe and gratitude in the face of the truth of Christ’s true historical reality, and the magnitude of the nobility required to enact the Christ event. In seeing the depths from a multitude of interpretive frameworks, it only serves to give further glory to God, a literal reality expressed within the biblical narrative. That the biblical narrative serves as archetypal for the purposes of psychological understanding, only deepens the conviction that it is valuable for teaching and correction.</p>
                <p id="content">The call to the individual to reconcile his ego with his shadow is in other words the call for self-reflection and true repentance. That following true repentance would come a transformation of the psyche, as augmented also by the living Holy Spirit. This transformation would then spill out into the world of individuals leading to a societal transformation. In other words the Holy Spirit brings the Kingdom of God, through God’s people.</p>
                <p id="content">As such, the modern Christian can have his cake and eat it; recognising in Jungian psychology the religious instinct that acknowledges the human soul and the symbolic relevance of the biblical story. Whilst also maintaining the literal, historical truths expressed, and clinging to the reality of a living God, and his promises of salvation and an eschatological hope.</p>
