                <h2>Aspiring Software Engineer</h2>
                <br>
                <p>I have studied programming in Python in the HyperionDev skills bootcamp, in which I have worked on projects working with variables, manipulating data structures, and object oriented programming. I have also used my spare time to study HTML on Codecademy, creating locally stored webpages.
                        

                I have a passion to learn and study, as expressed in my Bachelors in Applied Theology, and I am keen to turn that enthusiasm toward the tech industry.

                My goal is to break into programming, looking particularly at Web Development and Game development, but keen to put my hand to any opportunity to learn and grow in programming.

                I have a broad range of experience in my career, starting as an activities instructor in sailing, windsurfing, climbing, and other outdoor activities. These roles have given me experience and soft skills required for working in educational and team settings</p>
