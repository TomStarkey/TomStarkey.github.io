    <h1>Videos</h1>
        <p id="content">Here are a sample of some of the short Youtube videos I have made over the years.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This first video was a 1:00AM spur of the moment project which came from me seriously enjoying this particular puzzle in "Life Goes On: Done to Death" </p>

        <p>There are also short clips from League of Legends. Some are successes, others failures or interesting moments. Below are some successes.</p>
        <iframe class="videos center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5OLlpDMXgR8" title="Where do you think you&#39;re going" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>A beautifully predicted hook to catch a Malphite mid-ulti.</p>
        <iframe class="videos center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YbQbBGUGb2A" title="One bouncy boi" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>Plays like these are why Rengar is my favourite champion.</p>
        <iframe class="videos center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ftNI4N_u3Ko" title="Such a shame...." frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>Here is a failure. I could not believe the timing on his level up, saving his life and getting him a kill. That darn minion! What makes this play feel more unfortunate is that I had timed my aggression so that I leveled up as I engaged on him. I was really proud of that move and then it all went wrong! You can hear the disappointment at the end.</p>
        <iframe class="videos center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lo_qPlnnijc" title="Toasty Jayce" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>This next one was a funny one for me. My sister and I love the show "Toast of London". In this video my celebration sounds identical to the main characters tedious voice acting role during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bYY8m1Lb2I&t=8s">golden scene</a>, in which he needs to enthusiastically exclaim "Yes" and he can't seem to get the tone right for his employers. Brilliant!</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are some other games involved in there as well. Counter Strike: Global Offensive for example.</p>
