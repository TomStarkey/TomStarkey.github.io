            <h1 class="about">About me</h1>
            <p class>I am a 24 year old Aspiring Software Developer. 
                Having worked for several years in the outdoor activities industry 
                and studying Theology for 3 years at Moorlands College, I am looking for a new kind of challenge.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When I was at school I loved studying maths and science, choosing those subjects also at A level.
                I am returning to that passion now in a new way as I learn more about implementing code in Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
                There is more about my professional experience at my LinkedIn and Github pages, which can be found on the homepage.
            </p><br>
            <p>I grew up in the North East of the United Kingdom, and at 18 did a gap year with Richmond Holidays,
                having the pleasure of working in Samos on the beach, and also in the Alpes in The Three Valleys.
                It was during this time I decided to study Theology in order to deepen my relationship with God.
                Since graduating in 2021, I have been searching for a trade both challenging and meaningful which 
                took me first to the familiar territory of activity instructing, and next to pursuing a 
                career in the technology industry.
            </p><br>
            <p>Below is a neat little way to tell some things about me. 
                If you think you know the answer, click the question mark and see if you are right.</p><br>
            
            <p class=>Q1 - What is my  favourite fruit?</p>
            
            <button onclick="reveal('question1','banana.png')" class="center" id="pictures">

                <img id = "question1"  src="question_mark.png" alt="Image not loaded"></img>
            </button>

            <p class="center">Q2 - What is my favourite programming language?</p>

            <button onclick="reveal('question2', 'python.png')" class="center" id="pictures">
                <img id = "question2" src="question_mark.png" alt="Image not loaded">
